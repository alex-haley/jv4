This is an example of Object-Oriented Programming, which shows off how this idiome making your code worse both in understanding and maintaining.
All stuff that you learn in school about OOP doesn't have any connection to how a computer even works, it makes writing programs slower,
understanding the code architecture slower, run this programs slower and teaches you useless stuff like code diagrams, objects, other kinds
of objects like interfaces and other crap.
So, I've left this repo of my school days here, just to show how bad OOP is, and I look at this example often to see how far I've come from 
writing programs like this.
